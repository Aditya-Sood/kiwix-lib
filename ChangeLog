kiwix-lib 0.2.0
===============

 * Generate the snippet from the article content if the snippet is not
 directly in the database.
   This provide better snippets as they now depending of the query.
 * Use the stopwords and the language stored in the fulltext index database to
 parse the user query.
 * Remove the indexer functionnality.
 * Move to C++11Â standard.
 * Use the fulltext search of the zimlib.
   We still have the fulltext search code in kiwix-lib to be able to search in
   fulltext index by side of a zim file. (To be remove in the future)
 * Few API hanges
   * Change a lot of `Reader` methods to const methods.
 * Fix some crashes.
